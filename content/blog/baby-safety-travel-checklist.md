Where are you traveling to with your little one this summer? Whether it is the beach, a lake, a bustling metropolis, or just grandma’s house, baby safety never takes a holiday. Here is an easy checklist to help you prepare, stay organized, and keep your baby happy and safe while traveling.

## Diaper Changing Supplies

Always take more diapers than you think you will need. Don’t forget plenty of wipes, which can also be used to wipe down dirty hands, faces, or toys, and a pad to change baby on wherever you go.

* Diapers and wipes
* Diaper changing pad
* Diaper rash cream and baby powder

## Feeding Supplies

Be prepared to keep baby fed and hydrated during travels. Pack snacks for both of you if in the event you get stuck in an airport or in traffic. Be aware of [TSA rules about traveling with breastmilk](https://www.tsa.gov/traveling-formula-breast-milk-and-juice), which typically requires extra screening of liquids over 3.4 ounces.

* Bottles
* Breast pump and supplies, if needed
* Formula, food, snacks, water
* Bibs

## Bath Time and First Aid Supplies

Accidents can, and will, happen during travels. Be sure to have plenty of first aid supplies on hand. Practice medication safety and secure your own prescription medications with a [locking pill bottle](/products/saferlock/) or secure [medicine lock box](/products/saferlock-box/) to prevent accidental overdose in the case your child accidentally gets a hold of the pills from your purse or carry-on bag.

*Updated:* Your baby's health care provider likely will discourage unnecessary air travel shortly after birth. Newborns have developing immune systems, and air travel increases their risk of catching an infectious disease, including COVID-19.

According to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/air-travel-with-infant/faq-20058539), If you travel with an infant, take steps to keep yourself and your baby safe. Get all eligible family members, including children, vaccinated to reduce the risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Also, wear a well-fitted, high-filtration face mask — such as N95 — in the airport and on the airplane, frequently wash your hands or use hand sanitizer, and avoid contact with obviously ill travelers. If your newborn is sick, don't fly unless your child's health care provider says it's OK.

* Locking medicine storage/first aid kit
* Pain reliever/fever reducer
* Medicines for motion sickness (ages 2 and up, ask your doctor)
* Bandages
* Teething rings
* Travel size soaps, shampoo, lotions
* Cotton swabs, cotton balls
* Wash clothes
* Towels
* Inflatable bathtub

## Clothing

<a href="http://www.weather.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check the weather</a> for your destination, and pack clothing appropriately. If you will be somewhere where the evenings cool down, take warmer pajamas or sweatshirts for the nights. Pack swimwear or sleeveless tanks for warm weather destinations. Always pack more than you think you will need — unless you have easy access to laundry facilities.

* Extra onesies
* Socks
* Pajamas
* T-shirts and shorts
* Swimwear, swim diapers, if needed
* Sweats and sweatshirts, if needed

## Comfort Items

Taking baby traveling to new and exciting places will be easier if you bring along some of the comforts from home.

Blanket

* Favorite stuffed animal
* Pacifiers
* Toys

## Baby Gear

Don’t forget to bring along gear to help keep your baby safe and secure while traveling. Instead of babyproofing an entire hotel room, you may find it easier to keep baby in a portable play yard or crib while you are in the room.

* Sling or baby carrier
* Baby seat or bouncer
* Travel play-yard
* Car seat
* Collapsible lightweight stroller

Traveling by air, car, or even sea can be stress-free if you keep organized, allow extra time, pay attention to baby’s safety, and have plenty of baby’s necessary supplies with you when you go.
