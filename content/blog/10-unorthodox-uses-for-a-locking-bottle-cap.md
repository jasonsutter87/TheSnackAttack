A locking bottle cap can help protect your family by keeping your prescription medications secure. But once your prescription is gone, what else can you do with the cap? Luckily, long after you have disposed of your unused pills, you can still use a locking bottle cap to help secure the smallest, most dangerous, or most valuable items you have around your home.

## 10 More Items to Secure with a Combination Locking Cap:

## Jewelry

Small but valuable jewelry items can easily fit inside a prescription pill bottle. Securing them with the combination locking cap can help ease your worry about them getting stolen while traveling or participating in your favorite activities. The [Safer Lock combination cap](https://shop.rxguardian.com/products/safer-lock) comes with an opaque white pill bottle, so no one will know that your diamond earrings or wedding ring are inside.

## Cash

Stash your cash inside the Safer Lock bottle when you are traveling, and slip the bottle inside a pocket, bag, or purse. The opaque bottle will help keep anyone else from knowing there is cash inside. If you want to further disguise your cash stash, add a couple of breath mints or vitamins that will rattle if the bottle is shaken.

## Keys

Repurposing a prescription bottle into a secret compartment to hide keys is nothing new. But adding the combination lock cap to the top can give your home an added layer of security. Now only the person who knows where the key is hidden and knows the combination code can access it.

## Matches or Lighters

If you have young children around the house, locking up matches and lighters can help reduce fire risk. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, children playing is the leading cause of child fire injuries. Children ages 3 to 5 typically begin showing an interest in fire, and boys are at a higher risk of death by fire than girls.

## Button Batteries

The small batteries found in remote controls, watches, calculators, digital scales, and hearing aids are one of [the most dangerous items in your home](/news/blog/surprising-child-safety-hazards-lurking-in-your-home). Toddlers, young children, and babies who find the small, silver-disc batteries could swallow them easily.

And choking is only one of the consequences of a swallowed button battery; if a button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, an electrical current can cause a chemical reaction that burns through tissues. Severe tissue damage and even fatal consequences could be avoided if button batteries are kept out of the hands (and mouths) of small children.

## Loose Coins

They may only be worth a few pennies, but the loose coins in your purse or on the counter are seriously dangerous. Swallowing coins is one of the most common choking hazards to infants and toddlers, where coins can easily get lodged in the esophagus. Parents and grandparents can help reduce this risk by keeping loose change from their purses, pockets, or cars locked up in a bottle with a locking cap.

## Magnets

Small magnets are yet another household item that may seem harmless, but represent a serious choking hazard for young children. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns about the dangers to children who ingest loose magnets, including surgeries, bowel perforations or fistulas, endoscopies, bowel resections, and other serious gastrointestinal injuries.

## Medical Marijuana

An estimated 5% of the adult population in the U.S. uses medical marijuana for chronic pain and other conditions. In the 23 states that have approved marijuana for medical use, many don’t have laws pertaining to packaging, and those that do require only a child-resistant cap. [Childproof caps are not safe, and most children can get into them with little effort](/news/blog/childproof-caps-vs-combination-locking-caps-whats-the-difference). Keeping medical marijuana in a locking bottle cap will help protect young children from the dangers of accidental pot poisoning.

## Vitamins and Supplements

They may seem harmless, but vitamins and supplements can be dangerous to young children. Iron overdose is one of the leading causes of children poisoning injury and death for kids under the age of six. Fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin A, D, and E can also be toxic in high doses. And many herbal supplements that are safe for adults [can be dangerous or toxic](/news/blog/10-innocent-supplements-that-could-poison-your-child) to a small child. A locking bottle cap can help protect your children from becoming a poisoning statistic in your home.

## Other Medications

You may have gotten a locking bottle cap to help protect a curious teen from experimenting with your opioid painkillers, but other [medications can pose a real threat](/news/blog/dont-have-an-rx-you-still-need-locking-medicine-storage) to your children, too. Blood pressure medications are some of the most prescribed drugs in the U.S, and overdose of a blood pressure medication can be fatal, particularly to a small child. When pills are easily accessible in grandma’s purse, on the kitchen counter, or on a bedside table, a curious toddler could quickly swallow a fatal dose.

A locking pill bottle cap helps [protect your family from opioid misuse](/news/blog/can-medication-storage-really-prevent-drug-addiction). But it can also help keep your family safe in a number of different ways. Don’t limit yourself to locking up only your painkillers. Use this innovative and secure device to help keep your small children safe from choking and poisoning hazards, or to help keep your smallest, most precious valuables safe from harm.
