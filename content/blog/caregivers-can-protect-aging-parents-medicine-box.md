If you’re a caregiver, you know that medication is often an important part of an aging adult’s daily routine. In fact, [2 out of 5 seniors on Medicare take at least 5 different medicines every day](http://www.mustforseniors.org/facts.jsp). What’s more, adults over 65 make up 13% of the population. Yet, [seniors consume more than one-third of total outpatient spending on prescription meds](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/prescription-drugs/trends-in-prescription-drug-abuse/older-adults). That’s a lot of medications to keep track of.

That makes medication safety a vital issue for caregivers and those they look after. Read on to find out how a locking medicine box can help keep your parents safe.

## Three Ways To Help Protect Your Aging Parents With A Medicine Box

### \#1: Prevent Prescription Theft

Because aging Americans take such a large number of prescriptions and other medications, they are at a higher risk for prescription theft.

A medicine lock box is an excellent way to help safeguard against theft.

If your loved one’s prescriptions are stolen, you have to go through the hassle of getting the prescription refilled early. If the drug is addictive, and thus more tightly regulated, you may not be able to get an early refill.

What’s more, it can be challenging to tell who is stealing from you. Prescription thieves are typically someone with regular access to your home. That means they might be someone you know well.

By limiting who has access to your meds, a lock box helps keep sticky fingers out of valuable medications.

### \#2: Prevent Drug Abuse

If your parent or loved one struggles with memory issues, they may forget to take a pill and be tempted to take two later to make up for it. Taking too much medication can lead to accidental overdoses or even addiction.

If you’re concerned that your parents may not remember to take their medications properly without help, look into getting a medicine lock box. That way, you can have greater control over when they take their medications.

### \#3: Prevent Accidental Overdose

A medicine lock box can help prevent accidental overdoses.

If your parent struggles with eyesight issues, they may not be able to read the dosage amount on a pill bottle and take a larger dose than needed. If they suffer from memory loss, they may accidentally take too many pills or take their medicine twice.

A medicine lockbox gives you greater control over when your loved ones’ medications are dispensed and who has access to them, helping to prevent tragic overdoses.

Being a caregiver is a lot of work. You’re caring for your kids and your parents, all while balancing a job and other responsibilities. Investing in a medicine lock box helps you manage your busy day by helping protect you from prescription theft and helping deter against drug abuse. It can even help prevent accidental overdoses.

In short, a medicine lock box grants you and your parents greater peace of mind.
