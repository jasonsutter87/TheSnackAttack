Texting has taken over. If you’re a parent of a teen, you probably know this better than anyone. It’s not to say this is a bad thing. Shooting a quick text is an easy way to communicate something fast.

But if you’ve ever been suspicious of your teens texting, and wondered if there was something more sinister to their conversations, you could be right.

Teens today are abusing prescription drugs in overwhelming numbers, and unfortunately, texting has made it a lot easier for them to communicate about these things without their parents knowing.

Monitoring your teen’s phone and online activities may give you the clues you are looking for to see if he is experimenting with pills. Your teen’s texts and chat conversations may look like Egyptian hieroglyphics to you, but you can decode the slang and acronyms with a little help.

Here are some of the texting terms, acronyms, slang and [drug street names](http://www.prescriptiondrugabuse.org/Prescription-Drug-Slang-and-Street-Terms.htm) that you don’t want to see on your teen’s phone.

A little knowledge can go a long way to protect your teen from the dangers of prescription pill misuse and abuse. Locking and [securing any prescription pills](/products/saferlock/) you have in the home goes a long way towards protecting your teen. Paying close attention to their activities, friends, behavior, and looking for [signs of prescription drug abuse](/who-we-serve/home-family/teen-addiction/signs-of-teenage-drug-abuse/) are critical if you suspect your teen may need help.
