On March 25, 2020, Gatekeeper Innovation, Inc., announced that Kevin Kane joined the Sacramento, CA company as CEO and member of the Board of Directors.

“Kevin Kane brings essential experience to Gatekeeper Innovation, Inc.,” explains outgoing CEO Kim Box.

“Kevin's leadership skills are essential for this point in our journey. He has led many technology companies to double-digit growth, increasing shareholder value resulting in multiple liquidity events over his 25-year career. Kevin’s experience in the healthcare vertical includes launching a joint venture with an electronic health record (EHR) SaaS offering for a multi-billion healthcare organization, which fits well with our product roadmap as we expand into the digital locking cap space in order to address medication adherence and analytics.”

As the company plans for explosive growth and integration into healthcare systems, Ms. Box will remain as President and Board member.

Commenting on his new role, Mr. Kane explains, “The mission of Gatekeeper Innovation is simple: Help save lives by preventing prescription drug abuse and accidental poisonings. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, thousands of Americans abuse prescription drugs every day, and opioid abuse alone is estimated to be a $78.5 billion annual problem. I look forward to joining the Gatekeeper team and working together to determine opportunities for our product portfolio within the global pharmaceutical drug delivery market, which is projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2023 from $1,2 trillion in 2018. I am also excited for the Sacramento region as we plan to set up manufacturing of our new product Rx Locking Cap™ in Sacramento, supporting the local job market and ‘Made in USA’ initiative.”

Most recently, Mr. Kane served as CEO of Linkd, a project management collaboration SaaS solution designed to increase project productivity in the capital-intensive construction space. A resident of the Sacramento region, Mr. Kane is involved in economic growth activities in the community.
