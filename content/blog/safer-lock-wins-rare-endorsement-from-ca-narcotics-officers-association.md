Can you put a face on the victims of America’s opioid epidemic? For millions of Americans, the answer is yes. Some are victims of overdose deaths. Others are suffering assault or injury at the hand of an addict in pursuit of narcotics. Parents are watching helplessly as their children [accidentally ingest a pill](http://saferlock.wpengine.com/studies-reveal-parents-failing-to-secure-opioids-at-home/) that mom or dad misplaced. Newborn babies are being born addicted to opioids in staggering numbers. Many chronic pain patients are having life-saving pills stolen while others are having increasingly difficult times getting a refill for a medication they desperately need.

Every day, [America’s opioid epidemic](http://saferlock.wpengine.com/need-know-americas-opioid-epidemic/) claims more victims.

And no one knows this better than the men and women fighting the opioid war on the front lines: the state and local law enforcement officers who are battling this epidemic every day.

## Narcotics Officers’ Association Endorses Safer Lock

The stakes are painfully high when it comes to keeping people safe from opioid misuse, abuse and diversion, so it’s high praise, indeed, to receive a rare endorsement from the <a href="https://www.cnoa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California Narcotic Officers’ Association (CNOA)</a>.

When the leading narcotic officer training association in the United States speaks, people listen.

In fact, CNOA has only endorsed two products in the organization’s 53-year history. “Now, through our endorsement of Safer Lock, we have a chance to support prescription drug abuse prevention and help avoid accidental overdoses in the community,” explains Joe Stewart, Executive Director of CNOA.

The opioid crisis has come with a big price tag. What is opioid addiction costing America, and can we continue to pay the rising cost of this epidemic?

The association will launch their endorsement of Safer Lock at their 53rd Annual Training Institute &amp; Law Enforcement Exposition in Reno, Nevada, from November 17-21.

Every day, its members witness the impact of prescription drug abuse in the communities they serve. “One of the more disturbing sights for a police officer to see is the devastation that drug abuse has on families and in the community,” states Gil Van Attenhoven, Director of Training for CNOA.

“Safer Lock can help prevent prescription drugs from getting into the hands of our children or out into the broader community where we know drug abuse creates an unhealthy and unsafe environment for our community members and our officers.”

Started in 1964, CNOA has grown to become the largest non-profit training association in California and the premier narcotic training and legislative advocacy association in the nation. The nearly 7,000 members of CNOA include local, state and federal peace officers, prosecutors, law enforcement personnel, and other national and international associates.

For over 50 years, CNOA has offered training in all areas of narcotic enforcement activities to the dedicated men and women who are our first line of defense against the proliferation of illegal drugs in California.

The partnership between [Safer Lock](http://saferlock.wpengine.com/) and CNOA can help keep medications in the right hands, preventing medication misuse and abuse that continues to contribute to the United States’ opioid epidemic.

Sandy Hancock, Vice President of Sales for Gatekeeper Innovation, emphasizes the power of this partnership with CNOA:

“Having the leading narcotic officer training association in the United States endorse the Safer Lock sends a strong message about our product’s ability to help keep children, officers and entire communities safe.”

Safer Lock is honored to receive this endorsement from an organization that is training the men and women on the front lines of this crisis.
