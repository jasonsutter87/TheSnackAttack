For the past 27 years, National Recovery Month has been observed in September to educate Americans that addiction treatment is available to all who are struggling, and that a healthy life and recovery are possible.

## Millions of Americans’ Lives have been Transformed through Recovery

At the heart of Recovery Month is a spirit of celebration. Millions of Americans have had their lives completely transformed due to a successful recovery program. Their successes are often unnoticed outside of their immediate circle of loved ones, family, and friends.

During Recovery Month, these stories have the chance to be told. Their victories are celebrated. Their addiction treatment accomplishments become a vehicle to inspire others.

## Recovery Month 2019: Together We Are Stronger

The theme for Recovery Month 2019 is *Join the Voices for Recovery: Together We Are Stronger*. This year’s theme highlights the value of family support throughout recovery.

According to [recoverymonth.gov](https://recoverymonth.gov/), an estimated 21.5 million individuals aged 12 or older were classified with a substance use disorder in the past year. Millions of families are facing the effects of their loved one’s substance abuse, and are looking for hope, encouragement, and the tools they need to navigate family recovery.

By focusing on the family recovery this year, Recovery Month hopes to inspire, encourage, and provide the tools (and hope) that will help these millions of American families persevere in the journey through addiction treatment.

## Get Involved: Find an Event, Share Your Story, Inspire Others

If you want to help share the message of hope and inspiration during Recovery Month, here’s how to get involved.

### Recovery Month Events

You can [find a Recovery Month event](https://recoverymonth.gov/events/find-events) near you. All across the nation, special celebrations such as art shows, picnics, open houses, sporting events, rallies, walk/ runs, festivals, prayer services and more are taking place. If you can’t find a local event, plan and organize your own to support recovery efforts in your own community.

### Share Your Story

By [sharing your personal story](https://www.recoverymonth.gov/personal-stories), you can help bring hope to millions of families and individuals who need it.

### Inspire and Support

You can help promote Recovery Month and support addiction treatment within your own local community, even if you don’t have a recovery story to tell. Help get the word out by sharing articles, blogs (like this one), and social media posts about Recovery Month on your Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts. You can download banners, logos, flyers and graphics to share on your own website, blog, or group pages, as well.
