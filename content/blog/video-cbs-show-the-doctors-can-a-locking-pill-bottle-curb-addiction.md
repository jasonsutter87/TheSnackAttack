In a recent episode of the Emmy Award winning talk show, The Doctors, Dr. Travis Stork, featured Safer Lock and tackled the question: Can a Locking Pill Bottle Curb Addiction?

“I like this concept,” said Dr. Travis Stork, ER physician and host of the show. “You can’t get into a lockable pill bottle, unless of course you steal the code somehow. I like this concept.”

Dr. Stork began the discussion with this staggering fact: **nearly 70% of teens who misuse prescription drugs get them from their medicine cabinets at home.**

The Safer Lock combination locking cap and bottle will only open when a 4-digit code is set. The code is personal, and is designed to prevent unauthorized access to prescription pills, such as highly addictive painkillers like Vicodin and Oxycodone.

“You’re bringing narcotics into the home for the first time and you have some teenagers, I think this could be really effective for this scenario,” says Dr. Stork.

## America’s Epidemic

Prescription drug addiction has reached epidemic proportions in America, one that lawmakers are trying to address on both state and federal levels. Recently, Illinois signed a new law into effect that will [require pharmacies to place a locking cap on all opioid prescription](/news/blog/new-law-holds-hope-for-prescription-drug-abuse-prevention) bottles.

Other lawmakers, such as [Sacramento Congressman Ami Bera](/news/blog/sacramento-congressman-ami-bera-fights-for-rx-drug-prevention), are hoping laws that address the disposal of prescription medication will help in the fight against prescription addiction.

From locking up meds to disposing of unneeded pills, the key to addiction prevention is deterrence. Deterring teens and young adults from misusing prescriptions could help curb addiction. One reason teens admit to using prescription drugs is the ready availability of opioids in the medicine cabinets of their homes. If your teen was curious and took one or two pills from a bottle in your home, would you notice?

The Doctors asked the question: Can a locking pill bottle help curb addiction?

The answer is yes.
