Kim Box, President and CEO of Gatekeeper Innovation, Inc., announced that Keith Degner has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Sales focused on providing medication safe storage in the health plan space. "We are fortunate to have Mr. Degner bring his insight, innovation and extensive experience to our company," she noted. "It is an important time for us to add key talent to help drive our mission to safely store medications in the home."

An accomplished executive with over 20 years of experience in the medical device manufacturing and home supply provider spaces, Mr. Degner is known throughout the industry for building creative, collaborative teams and forward-thinking programs that deliver a competitive edge. Most recently, Mr. Degner was Vice President of National Accounts for Shield HealthCare, where he established Shield's first national accounts team. He developed Shield's Managed Care value proposition, sales cycle progression, and proof of concept through successfully closing national and regional MCO contracts.

Mr. Degner will be focused on building relationships and negotiating contracts with payers as they look to include the Safer Lock and Rx Locking Cap products into their health care delivery systems. "I'm looking forward to working alongside health care executives to shift the paradigm of prevention. Embedding prescription locking devices into the protocol of medical care represents a huge sea change in what doctors prescribe, how they prescribe it, and how it is handed over to the patient. After over 20 years in medical sales, I'm very excited to have this rare opportunity to make a difference in real lives."

Mr. Degner has a Master of Business Administration from the University of Phoenix and a B.S. in Business Administration from California State University, Chico. A native of the Sacramento Region, Mr. Degner lives in Placer County with his wife, Stacey, where they cheer on their son at lacrosse tournaments and their daughter at equestrian events.
