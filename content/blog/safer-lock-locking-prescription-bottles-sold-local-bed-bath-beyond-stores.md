Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey — September 28, 2016 — Retail giant Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is helping prevent prescription drug abuse locally by carrying Safer Lock locking prescription bottles; $12.99.

According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 1.9 million Americans have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers. Often home is where drug addiction begins. Over 40% of teens have abused a drug stolen from a parent's medicine chest. Locking up prescription medications is an effective deterrent.

Safer Lock is a four-digit (10,000 possibilities) combination locking cap developed to help prevent unauthorized access to prescription medication. Set the combination to your (the patient's) personal preference. Without knowing the combination, no one can access the prescription inside. The locking cap comes with its own bottle; it also fits a wide variety of prescription bottles.

Safer Lock also helps ensure that young children aren’t accidentally poisoned by powerful medications. Unlike childproof caps, a combination cap cannot be twisted off by a determined toddler. At the same time, Safer Lock is actually easier for seniors to twist open than a childproof cap.

### Safer Lock is located near the checkout counter in the following cities:

* Bethel Park, PA
* Cherry Hill, NJ
* Deptford, NJ
* Jenkintown, PA
* King of Prussia, PA
* Lancaster, PA
* Plymouth Meeting, PA
* Randor, PA
* Springfield, PA
* Stowe, PA
* Warrington, PA
* Whitehall, PA
* Wilkes-Barre, PA
* Wilmington, DE
