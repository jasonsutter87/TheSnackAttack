## How to Safely Secure Your Prescription Medications

Safely securing your prescription medications is easy. Choose a locking [medicine storage option](/news/blog/medicine-storage-tips-to-keep-your-kids-safe) that best fits your needs:

## Locking Medicine Boxes

If you have numerous prescription or over-the-counter medications in your home, a locking medicine storage box may be your best option. With a lock box, you can keep all of your medications safely in one location. If you like to organize your pills into a day-of-the-week container, you can also store this in your medicine box.

## Locking Prescription Bottles

If you only have one or two prescription medications in your home, a combination locking bottle cap may be the right solution to secure your meds. This is also a great solution if you need to keep your prescription on you, or close by. Meds that are carried in a purse, left out on a counter, or stored on a bedside table should always be fitted with a secure, locking cap. A locking bottle cap is [far more effective at keeping a young child out of a medicine bottle](/news/blog/childproof-caps-vs-combination-locking-caps-whats-the-difference) than a childproof or child resistant cap.

Young children are at risk any time a prescription medication is in their home. Whether it is dad’s cholesterol lowering statin drug, mom’s birth control pills, or grandma’s osteoarthritis medicine - one small pill could mean poisoning, hospitalization, or even worse to curious youngster.
