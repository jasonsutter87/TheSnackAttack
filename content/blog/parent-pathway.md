<h2 align="LEFT">Parent Pathway</h2>

<p align="LEFT"><a href="http://www.parentpathway.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Parent Pathway">Parent Pathway</a>&nbsp;provides information, help, community and hope to the parents of teens addicted to drugs and alcohol. It has been created by parents who understand what it is like to have a child struggling with addiction. Their goal is to let parents know that they are not alone, others have traveled this path and we are here to help. Our desire is that you will find a sense of hope and community along with helpful resources</p>
